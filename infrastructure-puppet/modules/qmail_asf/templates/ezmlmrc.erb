# #######
#
# TODO: consolidate -MUXYz and -MuXYZ configs for commit and user lists,
# respectively.
#
# Controls the actions of ezmlm-make as patched with ezmlm-idx-0.40 or later.
#
# The base directory 'DIR' is always created by ezmlm-make, as is DIR/key.
# Everything else is done from here.
#
# ezmlm-make looks for this file, first as .ezmlmrc in the directory that the
# lists .qmail files will be placed in (if you've used the -c command line
# switch), then /etc/ezmlmrc, then ezmlmrc in the ezmlm-make binary directory.
# Thus, you can customize ezmlm-make on a global level by placing a customized
# copy of ezmlmrc in /etc and on a user level by copying it to .ezmlmrc in
# the user's home directory AND use the ezmlm-make -c switch.
#
# Tags are:
#	</filename/>       : put succeeding text lines in DIR/filename
#	</-filename/>      : erase DIR/filename.
#	</+dirname/>       : create directory DIR/dirname
#	</:lname/dirname>  : symlink DIR/.qmail-list-lname -> DIR/dirname
#
# The name in the tag can be suffixed with '#' and any number of flags,
# corresponding to command line switches. The item will be created/extended
# only if all the flags listed are set. Files can be extended as long as they
# were the last one created, but not if another file has been started since
# then. Flags that are not recognized are silently ignored.
# 
# Thus, </filename#aP/> creates the file if and only if the list is archived
# (-a) and not public (-P). If the next tag is </filename#m/>, the file is
# extended with the lines up to the next tag if the list is message moderated
# (-m). If the next tag is </another/>, 'filename' is closed. Any further
# tags leading to the reopenining of 'filename' will overwrite the file, not
# extend it.
#
# A set of user-defined command line switches (xX, yY, zZ) are custom
# for apache.org.
#
# Within the text, certain tags are substituted. Other tags are copied as
# is. <#A#> and <#R#> are substituted by ezmlm-manage and -store (see man pages)
# and <#l#> (lower case L) is replaced dynamically by the list name for
# programs handling both 'list' and 'list-digest'.
#
# Substitutions are:
# <#B#> ezmlm binaries path   <#C#> digest code         <#D#> dir
# <#H#> host                  <#L#> local               <#F#> flags
# <#T#> dot                   <#0#> arg for -0. <#3#>...<#9#> arg for -3..9
# <#1#> ext1                  <#2#> ext2 [if dot is /path/.qmail-ext1-ext2-name]
# The latter useful when a single user is controlling several virtual domains.
#
# -0 is used for the main list address when setting up sublists
# -4 for specifying the ezmlm-tstdig switches used in dir/editor. Default
#    -k64 -m30 -t24. Only used if -g is used.
# -5 for list-owner address. Mail to list-owner will be forwarded to this addr.
# -6 for sql connection info
# -7 for contents of DIR/modpost
# -8 for contents of DIR/modsub
# -9 for contents of DIR/remote
#
# -x switch results in the following non-standard actions:
#    - Drop any messages containing Precedence: bulk
#    - Remove many non-text MIME parts from messages (see mimeremove).
#    - Limit posts to 2 bytes <= msg body size <= 1000000
# -X switch means
#    - Do not reject bulk senders, limit size, nor remove parts
#
# -y switch copies mail delivery to security@apache.org
#
# -z switch depends on -m:
#    -mz = moderate after checking From: anyone@apache.org (e.g., announce)
#    -Mz = unmoderated, but requires post sender to be @apache.org
#
# Typical settings by type for lists@project.apache.org:
#    announce    : -mUXYz   (moderated only after From: anyone@apache.org)
#    commits     : -MUXYz   (limit sender to anyone@apache.org)
#    security    : -MUXyZ   (anyone can post, send copy to security@apache.org)
#    users       : -MuXYZ   (limit to subscriber or apache.org sender)
#    dev,private : -muXYZ   (limit to subscriber|moderated|apache.org sender)
#                  -muxYZ   (limit to subscriber|moderated|apache.org sender
#                            after size/mime check)
#
# Attempts to create links or directories that already exist will result
# in a FATAL error. Attempts to open files that have already been closed
# or already exist will cause the old file to be overwritten.
#
# One of the major problems with ezmlm-lists is DIR/inlocal. For normal
# users, it is set up to the list name (user-list or so), which is correct.
# However, for user 'ezmlm' in control of virtual domain 'host.dom.com'
# the list name is 'list@host.dom.com', but inlocal should be 'ezmlm-list',
# not 'list'. Similarly, if ezmlm-domain1 is in control of 'host.dom.com,
# list@host.dom.com, should yield an inlocal of 'ezmlm-domain1-list'. To
# always get the lists correct, place this file as '.ezmlmrc' in the 
# users home directory (~ezmlm/.ezmlmrc) and change the inlocal text below
# to 'ezmlm-<#L#>' or 'ezmlm-<#1#>-<#L#>, respectively.
# config to support future editing without giving ezmlm-make command line
# arguments other than dir. Useful for GUI/WWW editing tools

--- Administrative commands for the <#l#> list ---

I can handle administrative requests automatically. Please
do not send them to the list address! Instead, send
your message to the correct command address:

To subscribe to the list, send a message to:
   <<#l#>-subscribe@<#h#>>

To remove your address from the list, send a message to:
   <<#l#>-unsubscribe@<#h#>>

Send mail to the following for info and FAQ for this list:
   <<#l#>-info@<#h#>>
   <<#l#>-faq@<#h#>>

</#d/>
Similar addresses exist for the digest list:
   <<#l#>-digest-subscribe@<#h#>>
   <<#l#>-digest-unsubscribe@<#h#>>

# ezmlm-make -i needed to add ezmlm-get line. If not, we can't do
# multi-get!
</text/bottom#ai/>
To get messages 123 through 145 (a maximum of 100 per request), mail:
   <<#l#>-get.123_145@<#h#>>

</text/bottom#aI/>
To get message 12 from the archive, send a message to:
   <<#l#>-get.12@<#h#>>

</text/bottom#i/>
To get an index with subject and author for messages 123-456 , mail:
   <<#l#>-index.123_456@<#h#>>

They are always returned as sets of 100, max 2000 per request,
so you'll actually get 100-499.

# Lists need to be both archived and indexed for -thread to work
</text/bottom#ai/>
To receive all messages with the same subject as message 12345,
send a short message to:
   <<#l#>-thread.12345@<#h#>>

# The '#' in the tag below is optional, since no flags follow.
# The name is optional as well, since the file will always be open
# at this point.
</text/bottom#/>
The messages should contain one line or word of text to avoid being
treated as sp@m, but I will ignore their content.
Only the ADDRESS you send to is important.

You can start a subscription for an alternate address,
for example "john@host.domain", just add a hyphen and your
address (with '=' instead of '@') after the command word:
<<#l#>-subscribe-john=host.domain@<#h#>>

To stop subscription for this address, mail:
<<#l#>-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@<#h#>>

In both cases, I'll send a confirmation message to that address. When
you receive it, simply reply to it to complete your subscription.

</text/bottom/>
If despite following these instructions, you do not get the
desired results, please contact my owner at
<#l#>-owner@<#h#>. Please be patient, my owner is a
lot slower than I am ;-)

Thank you for agreeing to moderate the <#l#>@<#h#>
mailing list.

My commands are a little different from other mailing lists,
but I think you will find them intuitive and easy to use.

Here are some instructions for the tasks you may have to perform
as a list-owner and/or moderator.

Remote subscription
-------------------
As a moderator, you can subscribe and unsubscribe any address to
the mailing list. To subscribe "john@host.domain", simply put
a hyphen after the command word, then his address with '=' instead
of the '@'. For instance, to subscribe that address, send mail to:
   <<#l#>-subscribe-john=host.domain@<#h#>>

You can similarly remove the address by sending a message to:
   <<#l#>-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@<#h#>>

</#d/>
For the digest list:
   <<#l#>-digest-subscribe-john=host.domain@<#h#>>
   <<#l#>-digest-unsubscribe-john=host.domain@<#h#>>

<//>
That's all. No subject and no message body needed!

</#r/>
I will send you a confirmation request, to make sure
that you really sent the request. Simply reply to the
message, and your wish has been granted.
</#R/>
I will send a confirmation request to the user address, in this
case <john@host.domain>. All the user has to do is to reply to 
this confirmation request message.
<//>

The confirmations are necessary to make it extremely hard
for a third party to add or remove an address to the list.

I will notify the user when his/her subscriber status
has changed.

Subscription
------------

Any user can subscribe or unsubscribe by sending mail to:

<#l#>-subscribe@<#h#>
<#l#>-unsubscribe@<#h#>

</#d/>
For the digest list:

<#l#>-digest-subscribe@<#h#>
<#l#>-digest-unsubscribe@<#h#>

<//>
The user will receive a confirmation request to make
sure s/he controls the subscription address. Once this
is verified the user is unsubscribed.

</#s/>
Since this list is moderated for subscriptions, I will send a
second confirmation request to the moderator(s). Since the user
has already confirmed the desire to be on the list, you as the
moderator can be highly confident that the subscriber address is
real. If you want to approve the users request, simply reply to
my CONFIRM message. If not, you can simply delete my message or
possibly contact the potential subscriber for more information.
</#S/>
Subscriptions work the same way.
<//>

The user can also use:

   <<#l#>-subscribe-mary=host.domain@<#h#>>
   <<#l#>-unsubscribe-mary=host.domain@<#h#>>

to have mail sent to "mary@host.domain". Only if she receives mail
at this address will she receive the confirmation request and be
able to reply to it.

Your address and identity will not be revealed to the subscriber,
unless you send mail directly to the user.

</#rl/>
To get a subscriber list for <#l#>@<#h#>, send a message to:

Moderated posts
---------------
When posts are moderated, I will save the posted message and send
you a copy together with instructions. The message to you will
have "MODERATE for ..." as the subject.

To accept the post, just reply to the 'Reply-To:', which I have
configured with the correct "accept" address address. You do not need
to include the post itself. In fact, I will ignore anything you send
me as long as the address you send to is correct.

If you want to reject it, send mail to the 'From:' address, which
I have configured with the correct "reject" address. This can
usually be done by 'reply-to-all', then deleting any address other
than the "reject" address. You may add a comment to the sender between
two lines starting with three '%'. I will send only this comment to the
sender with the rejected post. Again, I will not reveal your identity.

I will process the message according to the first reply I receive.
If you send me a request to accept a message that has already been
rejected or vice versa, I will let you know.

If I receive no moderator replies within a certain period of
time (normally 5 days), I will return the message to the sender
with an explanation of what happened. You administrator can also
set up the list so that such "ignored" messages are simply deleted
without notification, rather than returned to sender.
<//>

Vacations
---------
If you are temporarily at a different address, just forward all messages
that have the correct 'Mailing-List:' header (or all that have subjects
starting with 'MODERATE for <#l#>@<#h#>'
or 'CONFIRM subscribe to <#l#>@<#h#>') to the
new address. You can then moderate from the new address. Alternatively,
you can forward the messages to a friend so that s/he can moderate
for you.

</#r/>
If you try to do remote administration from an address that is not
your own, the subscriber, not you, will be asked to confirm. After
that, a moderator confirm request is sent to all moderators.
I'm doing this because I have no way of knowing that it is you that
sent the original request.

Please note that your original request (and your address) are sent to
the subscriber in this case!

Good luck!

Oops, that confirmation number appears to be invalid.

The most common reason for invalid numbers is expiration. I have to
receive confirmation of each request within ten days. Also, make sure
the entire confirmation number was in the reply you sent me. Some 
e-mail programs have a habit of cutting off some of the reply address,
which can be quite long.

I've set up a new confirmation number. To confirm that you would like

This confirmation serves two purposes. First, it verifies that I am able
to get mail through to you. Second, it protects you in case someone
forges a subscription request in your name.

Please note that ALL Apache dev- and user- mailing lists are publicly
archived.  Do familiarize yourself with Apache's public archive policy at

    http://www.apache.org/foundation/public-archives.html

prior to subscribing and posting messages to <#l#>@<#h#>.
If you're not sure whether or not the policy applies to this mailing list,
assume it does unless the list name contains the word "private" in it.

</#q/>
Some mail programs are broken and cannot handle long addresses. If you
cannot reply to this request, instead send a message to
<<#l#>-request@<#h#>> and put the
entire address listed above into the "Subject:" line.

I haven't checked whether your address is currently on the mailing list.
To see what address you used to subscribe, look at the messages you are
receiving from the mailing list. Each message has your address hidden
inside its return path; for example, mary@xdd.ff.com receives messages
with return path: <<#l#>-return-<number>-mary=xdd.ff.com@<#h#>.

Acknowledgment: The address

!A

was not on the <#l#> mailing list when I received
your request and is not a subscriber of this list.

If you unsubscribe, but continue to receive mail, you're subscribed
under a different address than you currently use. Please look at the
header for:

'Return-Path: <<#l#>-return-1234-user=host.dom@<#h#>>'

The unsubscribe address for this user would be:
'<#l#>-unsubscribe-user=host.dom@<#h#>'.
Just mail to that address, substituting user=host.dom for the real
values, reply to the confirmation request, and you should receive a message
that you're off the list.

For some mail programs, you need to make the headers visible to
see the return path:

For Eudora 4.0, click on the "Blah blah ..." button.
For PMMail, click on "Window->Show entire message/header". 

If this still doesn't work, I'm sorry to say that I can't help you.
Please FORWARD a list message together with a note about what you're
trying to achieve and a list of addresses that you might be subscribed
under to my owner:

    <#l#>-owner@<#h#>

who will take care of it. My owner is a little bit slower than I am, 
so please be patient.
